## Two Techonological Tools
### Tool one: Code.org built in IDE
- Name: Code.org built in IDE
- Purpose: Creates a space to practice writing the code of the specific skill of the lesson
- Classes: Intro to CS, AP CSP, AP CS A (all using the code.org curriculum)
- Uses: It works very well to practice the specific skills as presented in the curriculum. 
Typically, I choose one early stage as a starter prompt, then I will select a stage as a good example to practice code reading and/or a code along.
The rest of the class period will be workshop where students read through the prompts themselves and I curriculate to help with struggling students.
The last stage of each lesson will be used as the summary.
- Reasons to use: I love the code.org curriculum, so there is little reason not to use it. The only problem is that they don't have well integrated general IDE environments for extra practice.

### Tool two: Google Classroom
- Name: Google Classroom
- Purpose: Assignment manager, student communication site, and gradebook (sort of, integrated gradebook with a different software)
- Classes: Intro to CS, AP CSP, AP CS A
- Uses: Used as the main repository for materials and assignments. Students can use this as their todo list and reminders. The interface makes it easy to post announcements and to email the entire class if needed. Adding guardians also makes it very easy to send mass progress reports home.
- Reasons to use: Very easy to use and my school has a custom google domain, so every class in the school uses Google Classroom. The big question would be whether to use something like github for an advanced class like AP CS A. I think the ease of use of Google Classroom makes it superior for students, though I think I will transition to github after the AP exam so students can get used to an industry used repository site.
