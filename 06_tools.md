## Two Techonological Tools
### Tool one: Code.org built in IDE
- Name: Code.org built in IDE
- Purpose: Creates a space to practice writing the code of the specific skill of the lesson
- Classes: Intro to CS, AP CSP, AP CS A (all using the code.org curriculum)
- Uses: It works very well to practice the specific skills as presented in the curriculum. 
Typically, I choose one early stage as a starter prompt, then I will select a stage as a good example to practice code reading and/or a code along.
The rest of the class period will be workshop where students read through the prompts themselves and I curriculate to help with struggling students.
The last stage of each lesson will be used as the summary.
- Reasons to use: I love the code.org curriculum, so there is little reason not to use it. The only problem is that they don't have well integrated general IDE environments for extra practice.
