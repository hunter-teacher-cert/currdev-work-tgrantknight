### Assignment 01: Compare
#### Course: AP CS Principles
#### Comparison of [code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) (which I use) and [BJC](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/course/bjc4nyc.html) (which I do not)

##### Major Differences
- BJC uses Scratch (entirely block based), code.org uses JavaScript (options for blocks and for text)
- BJC is very project and programming focused
- BJC does not include any test assessments, code.org has unit exams
- BJC is very project focused, while code.org is a little more guided

##### Major Similarities
- Units 1 and 2 of code.org are in Unit 4 of BJC (and parts in Unit 5)
- Unit 5 of code.org is in Unit 2 of BJC
- Units 3, 4, 7 of code.org are in Unit 1, 2, 3, 5 of BJC
- Unit 5 of code.org is in Unit 5 of BJC
- For the Internet, both use similar visual representations of networks

##### Comparative Strengths & Weaknesses
- Both curricula need additional test prep resources
- Non-Programming ideas are a little out of place in BJC (like the copyright projects)
- While both are heavier on concepts instead of mastering a specific language, code.org at least allows for text based to be used

##### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
- BJC has some cool post-AP units, like Unit 6 in BJC, which includes some physical computing ideas
- Some projects could be taken from BJC to provide some open ended projects for code.org
