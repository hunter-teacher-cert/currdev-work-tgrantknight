## Week 4: Choosing a Language to Teach ##
### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
AP CSP, mix of 10th-12th grade
Some students may have taken the 9th grade Intro to CS elective

### What is the language?
Snap

### How does one write & run code in this language?
Code is written in a drag-and-drop workspace using different event hats as code triggers.
Available code is organized by type of command in a series of toolboxes.

### Rate the complexity of the syntax
The syntax is extremely simple. Code is written in a collection of blocks, themselves written using plan English.
Events can be triggered through various triggers, which allows for complex behavior while keeping the syntax itself straightforward.

### Strengths
Very focused on the bigger picture programming concepts without geting bogged down in difficult syntax.
Compare this to Java, where for newer students it's unclear whether they made a real mistake or just forgot a ; or {}.

### How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
AP CSP is very focused on bigger picture understanding of programing concepts. The language of the AP exam is entirely psuedocode blocks and text.
This can be converted to and from SNAP blocks.

### Weaknesses
SNAP does not prepare students for other written languages. By using simplier terms like repeat instead of different loop types, for example, 
students will struggle on adapt to other languages.

### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Teach the SNAP blocks directly with the AP pseudocode blocks, which could serve as a bridge to traditional textbased languages.

### Why did you select this language for this class?
BJC, a common curriculum for AP CSP, is built around using SNAP to highlight the bigger picture. I currently teach AP CSP with JavaScript as the primarly language.
Lower-level students often get bogged down with heavier syntax. SNAP could serve as a good alternative for these students.
