### Assignment 00: Standards

#### NY CS Standard #1: 9-12.CT.6
##### Text of standard: 
Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.
##### Activity Description:
AP CSP standards include differentiating between binary search and linear search, which are two example algorithms that fit the standard.
In pairs, students are given cards with the task of figuring out to check if there is an ace hidden in their cards.
After trying their own methods, students are guided through the linear and binary searches.
Students then compare the time it would take to find the aces.
Finally, we put out a ton of cards across the front of the room and determine which method would be more effective.

#### NY CS Standard #1: 9-12.CT.3
##### Text of standard: 
Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set.
##### Activity Description:
Many later activities in AP CSP involve using connected lists to represent columns from online datasets. 
Code.org in particular has a large set of data tables with built in functions to turn the table into lists when declared in code.
Students are tasked with building a UI for a given dataset, including highlighting on specific piece of information from the dataset.
